# Welcome to Save-A-Bull 🐂 👋

This is an app that helps USF students save money weekly, using a fun gamified method, having Rocky the Bull move through a roadmap of prizes.
The more you save, the more reward points you gain, the bigger prizes you win!

3 EASY STEPS: Just log in, scan your receipts, redeem your prizes!

Using React Native, Google Gemini Vision, and Google Firebase, we are able to create an app that incentivises students to save more and win prizes such as a free drink, VIP Student Section tickets to a USF Football game, and 40% off student parking.

This app is made with the intention that it can be partnered with the University of South Florida, increasing student engagement on campus, benefitting both the student and the university.
